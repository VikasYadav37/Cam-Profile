# Cam-Profile.

## 🔧 Features

- Implemented 3-4-5 motion curve for smooth displacement
- Python-based Jupyter Notebook for visualization and simulation
- Suitable for flat-face follower cam profiles
- Plots of displacement, velocity, and acceleration

## 📁 Files

- `cam.ipynb` – Main notebook for motion curve simulation and analysis

## 💡 Method

The 3-4-5 polynomial curve ensures:
- Zero initial and final velocity and acceleration
- Continuous and smooth jerk-free motion

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `matplotlib`, `numpy` (install via pip if not present)

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
